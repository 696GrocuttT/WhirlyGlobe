## WhirlyGlobe-Maply: Globe and map SDK for iOS and Android

Based on Metal for iOS and OpenGL ES for Android and focused on mobile first, WhirlyGlobe-Maply is used in a wide variety of altas, weather, visualization, and map apps.  The SDK is both a 3D interactive globe for iOS and a 2D flat (or slippy) map for iOS and Android.  It's all open source.
The feature list is pretty long, but here are a few things you can display with the toolkit.
