### Code Blocks

There are times you’ll need to enter project settings, code, or commands in the Terminal verbatim. They will look like this.

{% highlight bash %}
Enter Precisely This Text
{% endhighlight %}

### Pre-Requisites

You should be familiar with the Terminal.  You’ll need to type a number of commands to get started.

We make use of [git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) and [github](http://github.com/).  A passing familiarity will help.

For Android development, we use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html). Android Studio comes with the Android Development Kit (required). If you are building from source, you will also need the [Native Development Kit (NDK)](https://developer.android.com/ndk/index.html).  You can install all that from the Android Studio interface.

The tutorial used Android Studio 3.5, but should work fine with newer versions.
