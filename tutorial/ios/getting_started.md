### Code Blocks

There are times you’ll need to ender project settings, code, or commands in the Terminal verbatim. They will look like this.

{% highlight bash %}
Enter Precisely This Text
{% endhighlight %}

### Pre-Requisites

You should be familiar with the Terminal in OS X.  You’ll need to type a number of commands to get started.

We make use of [git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) and [github](http://github.com/).  A passing familiarity will help.

For iOS development, you’ll need a recent version of [Xcode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xcode).

Xcode 11.3 and WhirlyGlobe­-Maply 3.0 were used to prepare this guide. If you're using a newer version of either, things might be different.
